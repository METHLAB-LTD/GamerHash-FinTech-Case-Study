## Overview and Origin

Gamerhash is a company founded in Poznan, Poland in Nov 2017 that aims to leverage gamer's computer hardware, for bitcoin mining, by running a distributed bitcoin mining network using member's GPU and paying them in bitcoin. Gamerhash is also behind Gamercoin, a ERC-20 token that is distributed as an additional bitcoin mining reward, and can be redeemed for gaming games that can be redeemed on Steam in the Gamercoin store run by Gamerhash. The Gamercoin white paper lists the Patryk Pusch as the CEO of the company. The idea for the company came from giving gamers a way to monetize their GPU's processing power, similar to other services like NiceHash. 

## Business Activities:

Bitcoin mining presents an interesting value proposition for gamers, especially since many gamers will already have the equipment for mining bitcoin. Gamers with a GTX3070 can mine up to about $100/month at current prices, paying itself off over a little more than a year assuming no change in the price of bitcoin. 

The Gamerhash software will download on to the users computer, and use excess processing power during idle time to mine bitcoin, and rewarding the owner for the use of their GPU, allowing gamers a way to generate income using gaming hardware, and possibly covering the cost of the hardware over time. The user will have to calculate if it is profitable for them to mine, factoring in energy costs, and heat generation considerations.

Gamerhash allows gamers to monetize the gaming equipment they already have, with a easy to use client, and crypto wallet.

## Landscape:

Gamerhash is one of the many new start ups entering the Fin Tech/Crypto ecosystem. Gamerhash's success will be tied to the success of bitcoin and the greater crypto ecosystem. As a distributed mining company, Gamerhash's income and balance will depend directly on the evaluation of Bitcoin, specially since we can assume the company has bitcoin on it's balance sheets at anytime, and increased retail interests in the company would also result of increasing Bitcoin prices and public interest.

Currently bitcoin mining is still a niche area, with few people having interest or hardware to make it a profitable venture. But GamerHash, and competitors like NiceHash, do present a value proposition to users that already have the GPUs due to some other interests and can pivot to monetize their hardware's idle time. Another interesting and unkwown factor for the company is the global chip shortage, how will a limited GPU supply impact the hashrate of Bitcoin, and the profitability of small, at home GPU Bitcoin mining.
